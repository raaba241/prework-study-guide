# <{PREWORK-STUDY-GUIDE-WEBPAGE}>

## Description

This website was created to help keep track of notes taken throughout the pre-work. Schoolwork can get unorganized fast if it's left untended to. I solved this issue by letting users take easy to read notes which are seperated by topics in a fast and responsive website. Through this project we learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git flow, deployment.
